ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA)
INCIDENT ID: INC-2024-BF-009
DATE: 2024-11-29
SEVERITY: SEV-1 (Global Outage)
AUTHOR: Principal Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On Black Friday 2024, the Core Banking System experienced a 45-minute outage. The root cause was identified as "Log Ingestion Backpressure" caused by high traffic volume saturating the Fluentd buffers.

2. IMPACT
- 120,000 Transactions failed.
- Estimated revenue loss: €4.5M.
- Reputation damage due to social media trending topic #JCloudDown.

3. TECHNICAL ROOT CAUSE
The payment processing service was configured to write logs *synchronously* to the local disk before acknowledging the transaction. 
- When traffic spiked to 50k TPS, the disk I/O became the bottleneck.
- The application threads waited for the disk write to complete, causing a thread pool exhaustion.
- This resulted in a "Cascading Failure" across the API Gateway.

4. REMEDIATION & ACTION ITEMS (Completed Q1 2025)
[x] Move to Asynchronous Logging (Log4j2 AsyncAppender).
[x] Decouple storage: Logs now ship to a central storage cluster (CephStore).
[ ] (PENDING) Implement Auto-Scaling for Storage Quotas. <--- THE CLUE FOR THE CURRENT INCIDENT
    *Status: Deferred to 2026 Roadmap due to budget constraints.*

5. LESSONS LEARNED
"We must never let a non-critical side-effect (logging) block the critical path (payments)."
If storage becomes unavailable, the system should degrade gracefully, not halt.
