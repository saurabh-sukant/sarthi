--------------------------------------------------
Q: Why is my FaceID looping back to the login screen? (Error BIO-FAIL-909)
A: This usually indicates a version mismatch between the Mobile SDK and the Core Auth API. 
   FIX: 
   1. Ensure the user is on app version v4.2.1+.
   2. Reset the Biometric Cache: Settings > Security > Reset Biometrics.
   3. If the user is on iOS 19.1, verify that the 'Secure Enclave' permissions are enabled in the OS settings.

Q: SMS OTP is not arriving.
A: Check the 'SMS-G7' gateway status. UK carriers often experience throttle limits during peak hours (10:00 - 12:00 UTC).
