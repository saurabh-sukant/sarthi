--------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: Verify Correlation ID in the Gateway Trace (e.g., TX-EU-7782).
STEP 2: Check the 'Status' field in the Core Ledger.
   - If 'PENDING': Check CephStore storage health.
   - If 'REJECTED': Check error code against PSD2-SCA compliance codes.
STEP 3: If latency is caused by Storage Quota (JCENG-3818), perform a manual flush of the /tmp/payment-buffer to the secondary S3 bucket.
STEP 4: Update the JIRA ticket status to 'Resolved - Manual Buffer Flush'.
